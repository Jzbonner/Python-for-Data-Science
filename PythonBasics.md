# Python 3 
Python is a first-class tool mainly because of its libraries for storing, manipulating, and gaining insight from data. 


## Introductory Information on Python: List, Dictionaries & Booleans 
Personal notes were taking down in physical format regarding these basic concepts behind the Python language. I have included a few useful links in regards to what will aid those in understanding the basic principles of Python, specifically data types, functions and methods and dev environments: 
* Python Basic: https://community.modeanalytics.com/python/tutorial/python-basics/
* Python Methods and Functions: https://community.modeanalytics.com/python/tutorial/python-methods-functions-and-libraries/

## Interactive Python
IPython stands for Interactive Python and can be used to run scripts (either directly in the IPython Shell or via .py files). A great resource for those that are completely new to Python can be found at [python for beginners](http://www.pythonforbeginners.com/basics/), where you can learn about how to install Python package manager, web application frameworks, debuggers, etc. You also learn about the general basics behind Python Syntax, Variables, Comments, DocStrings, Booleans, Operators, Exception Handling, List, Strings, Dictionaries, Loops, Functions, Conditional Statements, Writing Files, and Language Rules. 

> The majority of my work in python will be done using the open source web application [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org/). I would recommend everyone to utilize this platform, either as an independent resource or through the Anaconda3 distribution. 

## Python: Pandas, Data Frames and Selecting Data 
The following information is summarized from the [Mode Analytics Community Reference Material](https://community.modeanalytics.com/python/tutorial/pandas-dataframe/). This information covered from this site will utilize the Pandas python library extensively (or at least enough to give a surface level efficiency with data frames and their uses). 

Pandas has two unique data structures: Data Frames and Series. A _data frame_ is a a table with multiple columns and a column of that data frame, or a list like object, is known as a _series_. A data frame is a table much like that in SQL or Excel and can be manipulated through specific operation; such as aggregation, filtering and pivoting. Data frames can operate very quickly while maintaining their mutability thanks to Python. 
* Data frames can load data through a number of different data structures and files. 
    * Including list and dictionaries, csv files, excel files and database records 

## Dataframes in Python with Examples 
The `datasets` object is a list where each item is a dataframe corresponding to one of the SQL queries in the Mode report (examples in subsequent sections will reference csv files as the sudo SQL database however [Mode](https://modeanalytics.com/tutorial/reports/326495548afb/python) utilizes an predefined SQL query to bring in data to their interactive python notebook). So `datasets[0]` is a dataframe object within the `datasets` list. Python allows you to give libraries aliases, so that you can reference them quickly in your code. The pandas library in python is typically aliased as `pd`. 

```python 
import pandas as pd 
```

SQL refers to missing values as `null`, by using the method `fillna()` you can replace missing values with empty strings in `datasets`. 

Example Utilization of Pandas and Datasets in Python: Analyzing web traffic data from a nonprofit website [Watsi](http://watsi.org/) by utilization of a predefined SQL query for historic data from the site. 

Row in Dataset | Description 
--- | ---
`referrer` | The url that referred the user to the site (if available). For example, if someone arrived at the page through a Facebook link, referrer would be https://www.facebook.com 
`timestamp` |  The time the event occurred
`title` | The title of the page the user visited on the Watsi website
`url` | The url the user visited. For example, https://watsi.org/team/the-meteor-chef
`user_agent` | The software the user used to accessed the site, including platform, browser, and extensions
`user_id` | A unique id for each user (normally they’d be numbers—we’ve turned them into anonymous names instead)
`referrer_domain` | The domain of the url that referred the user to the site. For example, “facebook.com”
`website_section` | The section of the website visited. For example, the section of https://watsi.org/team/the-meteor-chef is “team”
`platform` |  The device platform the user visited from. Possible values are "Desktop" and "Mobile"

Brackets are utilized to select a value in a list or dictionary, and similarly you can use brackets to select a column in the DataFrame. For Example: 

```python 
input ~ 
data['url]

output ~ 
0                        https://watsi.org/
1    https://watsi.org/team/the-meteor-chef
2              https://watsi.org/gift-cards
3                        https://watsi.org/
4                        https://watsi.org/
Name: url, dtype: object
```

You can select rows by using brackets and row indexes. By using :notation between brackets you can select specific values according to their indexes. For example `data[:3]` wil provide you with the values up to index 3, `data[4:7]` will provide you with the values from index 4 up to - but not including - index 7, and `data[4997:]` will provide you with everything from index 4997 onwards. In order to select rows you have to use the `data.ix[]` method on your datasets. 

Selecting series from your datasets can be done individually or simultaneously. Meaning that you can select rows and columns separately or together. For our above example you may utilize something like `data['title'][:3]` to select the first three rows of the `title` column or `data['referrer'][10:15]` to select the indexes from 10 to 15 of the `referrer` column.

For this section and future sections, we will be working with a CSV file containing information on the FDIC Failed Bank List, entitled _Finance.csv_. 

> Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation — The FDIC is often appointed as receiver for failed banks. This list includes banks which have failed since October 1, 2000.

By utilizing some of the previous concepts discussed above, we will set up python environment that loads locally stored csv information and presents the first few rows of the csv in a `dataframe`. All sample csv data is being taken from [Data.gov](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset). Priming your csv file in Jupyter Notebook should begin as follows: 

```python 
import pandas as pd

data = pd.read_csv('Finance.csv')
data.fillna('')

data.head(n=8)
```
