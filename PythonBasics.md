# Python 3 
Python is a first-class tool mainly because of its libraries for storing, manipulating, and gaining insight from data. 


## Introductory Information on Python: List, Dictionaries & Booleans 
Personal notes were taking down in physical format regarding these basic concepts behind the Python language. I have included a few useful links in regards to what will aid those in understanding the basic principles of Python, specifically data types, functions and methods and dev environments: 
* Python Basic: https://community.modeanalytics.com/python/tutorial/python-basics/
* Python Methods and Functions: https://community.modeanalytics.com/python/tutorial/python-methods-functions-and-libraries/

## Interactive Python
IPython stands for Interactive Python and can be used to run scripts (either directly in the IPython Shell or via .py files). A great resource for those that are completely new to Python can be found at [python for beginners](http://www.pythonforbeginners.com/basics/), where you can learn about how to install Python package manager, web application frameworks, debuggers, etc. You also learn about the general basics behind Python Syntax, Variables, Comments, DocStrings, Booleans, Operators, Exception Handling, List, Strings, Dictionaries, Loops, Functions, Conditional Statements, Writing Files, and Language Rules. 

> The majority of my work in python will be done using the open source web application [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org/). I would recommend everyone to utilize this platform, either as an independent resource or through the Anaconda3 distribution. 

## Python: Pandas, Data Frames and Selecting Data 
The following information is summarized from the [Mode Analytics Community Reference Material](https://community.modeanalytics.com/python/tutorial/pandas-dataframe/). This information covered from this site will utilize the Pandas python library extensively (or at least enough to give a surface level efficiency with data frames and their uses). 

Pandas has two unique data structures: Data Frames and Series. A _data frame_ is a a table with multiple columns and a column of that data frame, or a list like object, is known as a _series_. A data frame is a table much like that in SQL or Excel and can be manipulated through specific operation; such as aggregation, filtering and pivoting. Data frames can operate very quickly while maintaining their mutability thanks to Python. 
* Data frames can load data through a number of different data structures and files. 
    * Including list and dictionaries, csv files, excel files and database records
