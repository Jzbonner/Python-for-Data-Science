# Python for Data Science
This repo serves as a workbook and resource for Applied Data Science with a Specialization in Python. 

> Data science comprises three distinct and overlapping areas: the skills of a statistician who knows how to model and summarize datasets > (which are growing ever larger); the skills of a computer scientist who can design and use algorithms to efficiently store, process, and > visualize this data; and the domain expertise—what we might think of as "classical" training in a subject—necessary both to formulate > the right questions and to put their answers in context"
