# Python for Data Science

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/Jzbonner/Python-for-Data-Science.git/master)

This repo serves as a workbook and resource for Applied Data Science with a Specialization in Python. 

> Data science comprises three distinct and overlapping areas: the skills of a statistician who knows how to model and summarize datasets (which are growing ever larger); the skills of a computer scientist who can design and use algorithms to efficiently store, process, and visualize this data; and the domain expertise—what we might think of as "classical" training in a subject—necessary both to formulate the right questions and to put their answers in context" 

(Jake VanderPlas, Preface).
