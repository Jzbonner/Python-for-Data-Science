There are numerous options for working with financial data in the fin tech space. I have chosen to utilize a platform that is catered to developers and offers both paper trading & live trading functionality. Requirements for development environment: 

➡ **Components**
* Alpaca Trading API (https://alpaca.markets/)
* Alphavantage Trading API (https://www.alphavantage.co/)
* Zipline Python Backtester (https://github.com/quantopian/zipline)

➡ **Strategy** 
Consolidating important data for analysis of various financial instruments and investments. This will required the use of a VPS and shared DB once prototyping begins. 
* Digital Ocean (https://www.digitalocean.com/)
* Datbase Hosting through Digital Ocean (https://www.digitalocean.com/products/managed-databases/)
