## Interactive Python
IPython stands for Interactive Python and can be used to run scripts (either directly in the IPython Shell or via .py files). A great resource for those that are completely new to Python can be found at [python for beginners](http://www.pythonforbeginners.com/basics/), where you can learn about how to install Python package manager, web application frameworks, debuggers, etc. You also learn about the general basics behind Python Syntax, Variables, Comments, DocStrings, Booleans, Operators, Exception Handling, List, Strings, Dictionaries, Loops, Functions, Conditional Statements, Writing Files, and Language Rules.
