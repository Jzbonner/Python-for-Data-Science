# Python 3 
Python is a first-class tool mainly because of its libraries for storing, manipulating, and gaining insight from data. 

## Interactive Python
IPython stands for Interactive Python and can be used to run scripts (either directly in the IPython Shell or via .py files). A great resource for those that are completely new to Python can be found at [python for beginners](http://www.pythonforbeginners.com/basics/), where you can learn about how to install Python package manager, web application frameworks, debuggers, etc. You also learn about the general basics behind Python Syntax, Variables, Comments, DocStrings, Booleans, Operators, Exception Handling, List, Strings, Dictionaries, Loops, Functions, Conditional Statements, Writing Files, and Language Rules. 

## Variables
Variables in Python are to have specific, case-sensitive names. Variables are also classified by various data types such as float, int, booleans, and strings. 

## List
A list can contain any Python type. Although it's not really common, a list can contain a mix of Python types including strings, booleans, floats, etc. List syntax is as follows `my_list = [el1, el2]` Python List can also contain other list.
